# This is a read me for project 2

Wasn't sure if the how to and pictures had to be our own, so I took them off the internet.

## Html coding

I think I'm coding correctly, but won't be sure until I push it.

### embedding images

I'm not sure how this is gonna turn out. Even simple image embedding hasn't worked for me in the past.

### What's done is done

I included the pictures and almost all of the html requirements, but I'm running out of time and worried that if I don't start trying to push it into github now, I'll run out of time.

Wish me luck

#### The 2nd part

Not off to a bad start, Figuring out the table system slowly but surely. also realizing that the tutorial I made doesn't make sense in a table, but I'm trying.

#### Still, the second part
Structuring the document isn't so bad, it's the creation of a directory that I'm worried about.

#### Now, the final push
I think I've met all the requirements in the HW and Now I'm going to wrap it up and upload.
